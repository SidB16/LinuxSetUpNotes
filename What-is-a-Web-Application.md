# What is a Web Application?

## Defintion
A web application is a computer program that utilizes web browsers, and web technology to perform tasks over the Internet.

For a business, effective management is only possible when it is able to ***capture*** and ***store*** all necessary data,
and have the means for ***processing*** this information and ***presenting*** the results to the user.


## How a web application works?
Web applications use a ***combination*** of server-side scripts (PHP and ASP), and client-side scripts (Javascript and HTML). \
***Server-side scripts to handle the storage and retrivel of information.*** 
***Client-side scripts to present infromation to users.*** 

Web applications are usually coded in browser-suppourted languages, like HTML and Javascript. 
These languages ***rely on the browser to render the program executable.*** 

Some applications are ***dynamic***, requiring server-side processing (generating dynamic content to provide the specialized functionality offered by a business, service, or application).
The way such dynamic web apps are displayed on a user’s screen is not predetermined but rather dynamically shaped by app logic that is implemented on the server side or the client side of the app.

While in a normal web application or the simple website. There is no request, response scenario. All and all it's just a client end with some HTML with some CSS or maybe Javascript or any other extension of Javascript. No server end.

While others are completely ***static***, requiring no server-side processing.

### In other words, 
A web application is a collection of static and dynamic web pages. A static web page is one that does not change when a site visitor requests it: The web server sends the page to the requesting web browser without modifying it. In contrast, a dynamic web page is modified by the server before it is sent to the requesting browser. The changing nature of the page is why it’s called dynamic.

For example, you could design a page to display fitness results, while leaving certain information (such as employee name and results) to be determined when the page is requested by a particular employee.

## Web server vs Application server
A web application requires a web server to manage requests from the client, a application sever to perfrom the requested task, and sometimes, a database to store information. 

Application sever technologies range from ASP.NET, ASP and ColdFusion, to PHP and JSP.

Here's what a typical web application flow looks like: 
1. User triggers a request to the web server over the Internet, either through a web browser or the application’s user interface
2. Web server forwards this request to the appropriate web application server
3. Web application server performs the requested task – such as querying the database or processing the data – then generates the results of the requested data
4. Web application server sends results to the web server with the requested information or processed data
5. Web server responds back to the client with the requested information that then appears on the user’s display

## Examples of a web application
Web applications include ***online*** forms, shopping carts, word processors, spreadsheets, video and photo editing, file conversion, file scanning, and email programs such as Gmail, Yahoo and AOL. \
Popular applications include Google Apps and Microsoft 365.

## Benefits of a web application
- Web application runs on multiple platform regardless of OS or device as long as the browser is compatible.
- All users have access to the same version, eliminating compatibility issues.
- They are not installed on a hard drive, thus eliminating space issues.
- They reduce software piracy in a subscription-based web application (i.e. SaaS).
- They reduce cost for both the business aIncreased Internet usage among companies and individuals has influenced the way businesses are run. This has led to the widespread adoption of web applications as companies shift from traditional models to cloud-based and grid models. Web applications give businesses the ability to streamline their operations, increase efficiency, and reduce costs.nd end-user, as there is less support and maintenance required by the business and lower requirements for the end-user's computer.

## End Remarks
Increased Internet usage among companies and individuals has influenced the way businesses are run. This has led to the widespread adoption of web applications as companies shift from traditional models to cloud-based and grid models.\
Web applications give businesses the ability to streamline their operations, increase efficiency, and reduce costs. 

These online apps such as email clients, word processors, spreadsheets, and other programs provide the same functionality as the desktop versions. However, they have an added advantage of working across multiple platforms, having a broader reach, and being easily accessible from anywhere.
