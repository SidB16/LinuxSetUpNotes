6) CMSIS-DAP Protocol
CMSIS-DAP provides a standardized way to access the Coresight Debug Access Port (DAP) of an ARM Cortex microcontroller via USB.

Different types of commands can be issued by the host:
General Commands: request information and control the debug unit. Also used to connect/disconnect the debug unit.
Common SWD/JTAG commands: used for instance to set the clock speed
SWD specific commands: configure the parameters for SWD mode
JTAG specific commands: configure the JTAG device chain
Transfer Commands: read/write CoreSight registers. These commands are independent of the transport (SWD or JTAG)
