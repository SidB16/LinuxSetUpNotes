Xterm is <3

 sudo ssh -X -f username@remote.host "command"
 
 Example:
 sudo ssh -X -f username@red.cse.yorku.ca "estudio &"
 &&
 sudo ssh -X -f username@red.cse.yorku.ca "quartus &"
 
 "When you use SSH to display the program, 
 it creates a dummy X server on the remote host that 
 forwards the X11 data packets through a secure connection to your computer. 
 The X server on your computer treats the program as if it is running locally."

"Note: Pay attention to what version of SSH is installed on both your computer and the remote host. 
Servers that run version 1 of the SSH protocol cannot communicate with clients that can only use version 2. 
Likewise, many SSH version 2 servers will refuse clients communicating with version 1 of the protocol, 
due to security concerns."
