Guide to Installing Rodin 3.3 Platform(with Pro-B Plugin already installed I believe) on Linux.

In this document I share the labours of 10 straight hours work deciphering dry 1990s documentation...

Long story short, you need jdk8 to run Rodin3.3 Platform. Any jdk > 8 will not work with Rodin 3.3 Platform.

Here are following steps I followed to successfully run Rodin3.3 Platform on my Linux machine:

1) Download the compressed (tar.gz, etc) Rodin3.3 Platform file from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/rodin-b-sharp/files/Core_Rodin_Platform/3.3/

2) Once installed try to execute the rodin binary file in extracted directory (Note: this extracted dir is also called rodin. The rodin binary file is inside it.)

3) If Rodin Platform launches after confuguring the "workspace", then your're done! :)
----------------------------------------or----------------------------------------
3) Else, 

4) Dowload jdk8 from https://adoptopenjdk.net/ 

5) Test the Rodin3.3 platform launches this time BUT execute the following command first to apply jdk8: export PATH=~/Desktop/jdk8/jdk8u232-b09/bin:$PATH

5) If test is successful then configure your shell $PATH to read the java bin from jdk8. (Tip: Insert at the head of the long $PATH string!) 

6) You're done :)
