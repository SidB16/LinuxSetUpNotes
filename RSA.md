# The RSA algorithm
Motivated by 3481 project. Course involves Assignment-[How to Solve and Write Up Homework Problems](http://www.box.net/shared/static/rs3mslti2r.pdf).

Strategy for course assignments: getting started, carrying out the work, checking your work, and writing up and proofreading your solution.
* Start early! Read over each problem on the day it is handed out so that you can ask questions about the assginemnt during the next class.
* Before handing in your solution, read, check, revise and proof read your work.
* Use good writing technique (use active voice, avoid wesel words, etc).
