## Internet/IP Deficiences
1. Initially, the internet (aka arpanet) was small and relatively private.
2. In private neworks, you dont need to build security into the protocol- you need to build it into the building.
3. Today, a mass of untrusted devices are connected to the internet.
4. Futhermore, routers are owned and administered by 'who knows who'.
5. Thus 'who knows who' stand between you and your others devices.
6. Back then only end-host attacks were possible, now attacks can happen from anywhere.
7. IP indirectly violates Integrity and Authenticity in the CIAAAA triad.
