1) First Document:
  \documentclass[12]{article}
  \begin{document}
    \section{Hello, World!}
  \end{document}
  Notes: 
   a) "An environment is simply an area of your document where certain
   typesetting rules apply. It is possible (and usually necessary) 
   to have multiple environments in a document, but it is imperative 
   the document environment is the topmost environment."
% Valid:
\begin{document}
  \being{env1}
  \end{env1}
\end{document}

% Invalid:
\begin{document}
  \being{env1}
  \end{document}
\end{env1}

% Example Document Build
  \documentclass{article}
  
  % "Preamble" - Title Page part
  \title{My first doc}
  \today
  \author{sid16}
  
  % Document Part
  \begin{document}
    % 'document' enviroment type setting rules
    \pagenumbering{roman}
    \maketitle % "This command will automagically create a titlepage for us". Using the preamble above OFC
    \new page
    
    \section*{Hello, World!}
    
  \end{document}
 
2)  Sections
    % Example of structuring a document- its "Easy" :)
\documentclass{article}
\title{Title}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\newpage
\pagenumbering{roman}

\section{Section1}
\subsection{subsec1}
Some text
\subsubsection{subsubsec1}

% within subsubsection
\paragraph{Paragraph. 4)  Math
5)  Figures
6)  Table of Contents
7)  Bibtex
8)  Footnotes
9)  Tables}
text to immediate right of Paragraph text! \newline
text on a new line
\subparagraph{SubParagraph}
text after subparagraph

\end{document}

Notes:
a) The sections will have successive numbers and appear in the table of contents
b) Paragraphs are not numbered and thus don't appear in the table of contents
c) Document Sectioning
"LATEX can organize, number, and index chapters and sections of document. 
There are up to 7 levels of depth for defining sections depending on the document class:
-1.	\part{part}
0.	\chapter{chapter}
1.	\section{section}
2.	\subsection{subsection}
3.	\subsubsection{subsubsection}
4.	\paragraph{paragraph}
5.	\subparagraph{subparagraph}
6. \part and \chapter are only available in report and book document classes."

3)  Packages
Notes:
 a) "In case of Ubuntu installing texlive-full"
 from the package manager would provide all packages available. 
 b) "All packages must be included in the preamble"
 c) "Packages add features such as support for pictures, links and bibliography"
 
4)  Math
There are two major modes of typesetting math in LaTeX 
one is embedding the math directly into your text by encapsulating your formula in dollar signs 
and the other is using a predefined math environment.
Notes:
a) use in preable section \usepackage{amsmath}
b) Inline formulas: This formula $f(x) = x^2$ is an example.
c) Equations:
  C.1) most useful math envorinments are the equation environment for typesetting single equations
        and the align environment for multiple equations
        \documentclass{article}
        \title{Equation Example}
        
        \begin{document}
        
        \section{Showing Equations}
        
        \subsection{#1- non-aligned example}
        \being{equation*} % Note the '*' here
          1 + 2 = 3
        \end{equation*}
        \being{equation*}
          1 = 3 - 2
        \end{equation*}
        
        \subsection{#2- Automatic Aligned math equation example}
        \being{equation*} % Note how two environments were not needed!
        1 + 2 &= 3\\ % '\\' is a line break!
        1 &= 3 - 2
        \end{equation*}
        
        \end{document}
  C.2) Furthermore it is not even possible to enter two equations 
       in that environment, it will result in a compilation error. 
       The asterisk (e.g. equation*) only indicates, that I don't want 
       the equations to be numbered.
  C.3)  \int^a_b for integral symbol
        \frac{u}{v} for fractions
        \sqrt{x} for square roots
        \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\right) for (1/sqrt(x))
  C.4) "The Lyx program offers a great formula editor, which can ease this work a bit."
        "Personally, I write all code by hand though, since it's faster than messing around with the formula editor."
d) Fractions:
e) Matricies:
f) Scaling of Parentheses, Brackets etc:

5)  Figures
  % Example of simple document inserted with caption!
  
  % Preamble
  \documentclass{article}
  \title{Figure Example}
  \usegraphicx
  
  % Document Part
  \begin{document}
    begin{figure} % could use '*' so that images are unumbered
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{capture.jpg}
    \caption{An image capture.}
    \label{fig:boat1}
  end{figure}
  Figure \ref{fig:boat1} shows a boat.
   
  \end{document}
  Notes:
  a) "The figure environment takes care of the numbering and 
     positioning of the image within the document."
  b) "In order to include a figure, you must use the \includegraphics command. 
     It takes the image width as an option in brackets and the path to your image file."
  b) "In this case the image is stored in the same directory as 
     my .tex file, so I simply put boat.jpg here to include it.
     For large documents, you probably want to store image files 
     in a different folder, say we created a folder images, then 
     we would simply write images/boat.jpg into the braces."
  c) \usepacakage{graphicx}
  d) "You can use the \ref command to refer to the figure (marked by label) in your text 
      and it will then be replaced by the correct number."

% Simple Lists Implementation
\documentclass{article}
\title{Ordered List Examples}
%\usepackage{}, no package needed!

\begin{document}
\newpage
\pagenumbering{roman}

\section{Simple Ordered List}
% Shortcut? use 'enumerate' macro!
\begin{enumerate}   
    \item Item 1
    \item Item 2
    \item Item 3
\end{enumerate}
\section{Ordered Nested List}
\begin{enumerate}
        \item item 1
        \item item 2
        \item item 3 \begin{enumerate}
            \item sub item 1
            \item sub item 2
        \end{enumerate}
        \item item 4
        \item item 5
        
    \end{enumerate}

\end{document}
Notes:
a) "Unordered lists can be created using the itemize environment."
b) "Ordered lists can be created using the enumerate environment."
c) "Lists can be nested and will be aligned and enumerated properly."
d) "Use the enumitem package to customize the symbols or enumeration."

Important fix for this VScode extension:
1) Open the project folder with VS Code (make sure, that your root file is in some subdirectory of this folder)
2) Open the .tex file from which you want to compile the document
3) Press F1 (or whatever hotkey you have assigned to the "Show All Commands"-command
4) Enter "root magic" - this should find the command "latex-workshop.addtexroot" (full name: Insert %!TeX root magic command) and pick the command.
5) A list of .tex files in the projects should open - start typing the name of your desired root filATH="/usr/local/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-linux/:e (main.tex) and press enter. This inserts a correctly formatted root-comment and removes incorrectly formatted/old root-comments (if if recognizes them)
6)Save the file and compile.
Source of thread for this^ fix:  https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/issues/776

Also, you need to install texLive package from offical website and update your $PATH to include /usr/local/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-linux/.
This path to texLive binaries which VScode will use to spawn processes and build pdf.
