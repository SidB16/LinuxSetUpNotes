# Outlook Mail with Zoom to effectively schedule and manage meetings?
In this doc I list the steps used to configure Zoom for Outlook mail

## Step1: Install Office 365 for your respective academic institution
At YorkU, we use eecsusername@yorku.ca to sign into https://myaccount.microsoft.com/
Upon sign-in, install the Office 365 application that imports lisences to local Windows10 OS.

## Step2: Configure IMAP forward on gmail account
In your eecsusername@my.yorku.ca gmail acccount --> "settings Cog symbol" located top right --> select "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" tab --> scroll down IMAP access, and select enable IMAP option.

## Step3: Configure Outlook to host email from eecsusername@my.yorku.ca gmail mailbox
Open the Outlook application, then select "configure account manually". 
Thereafter, enter:
email: eecsusername@my.yorku.ca
user:eecsusername
password: eecs-password

## Step4: Download and Install the Zoom Client, and Zoom Plugin for Microsoft Outlook packages
These packages can be found from here: https://zoom.us/download/


## Step5: Configure Zoom as a Add-in in Outlook 
Once your eecsusername@my.yorku.ca emails are configured correctly to come to Outlook on your Windows machine, 
open Outlook--> File --> Options --> Add-ins --> Select the "Go" button at near the bottom of the window --> select the "plugin_Launcher" file located in the C:ProgramFile(x86) (this is where you installed the plugin).
This was my Zoom Outlook Plugin's location ==> C:\Program Files (x86)\Zoom\Zoom Outlook Plugin\plugin_Launcher

## Step6: Test the Zoom Add-in was succesful, and sign-in to the Zoom Client
You can test your build was successful if the "Zoom" tab shows up on Outlook's "Ribbon" i.e. toolbar underneath the Home tab.
If so, sign into your Zoom client application. This is update the plugin added-in Outlook mail application.

## Step7: Schedule Meeting in Outlook Mail using Zoom plugin
Manage your meetings effectively using Outlook with Zoom-- best of luck with school! :smile:
